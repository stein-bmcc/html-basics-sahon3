    <p>Hierloom tomatoes. A wire cable. Some guy screaming. Boots. Cozy hoodie. 0.7 ink pen. Something about a bear getting into a crate of cocaine and getting a movie about it.</p>

        <img src="images/pexels-cottonbro-6636091.jpg" alt="0.7 ink pen.">
        <figcaption> I have not used a pen for anything other than signing things ever since I started college. Art class has removed the use of the pen from my daily life :\ </figcaption>

        <img src="images/pexels-cottonbro-5090637.jpg" alt="Random wire cables.">
        <figcaption> This is exactly what the mouse wire for the Mac computers in Multimedia looks like. It's just kind of annoying how tangled the wire is.  </figcaption>

        <img src="images/pexels-mali-42164.jpg" alt="Hierloom tomatoes">
        <figcaption> I only know these exist because of Rick and Morty, which I never got fully into but might do so sometime in the future. I have said this same thing for many other TV shows. </figcaption>

    <figure>
        <img src="images/pexels-olly-3907674.jpg" alt="Guy yelling">
        <figcaption> There is no shortage of homeless people screaming on the train commute to this school, and it gets even more strange every time. At least my commute to school isn't boring anymore.</figcaption>

        <img src="images/pexels-ozgomz-1755386.jpg" alt="Timberlands">
        <figcaption> For some reason, I've been wearing boots more often in college than I ever have in general. I guess I felt comfortable and confident enough to wear them regularly.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p> You know, college has really opened my eyes to the reality that I'm an adult now. I'm responsible for myself, and I need to make sure that I don't fall behind. But at the same time, I need to enjoy my life so I'm not slaving away. Maybe I've been doing more of one than the other.</p>
