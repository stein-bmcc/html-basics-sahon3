        Let's see.. hmmm... I'm trying to come up with something here. What can I really say, I don't know what I'm doing. Don't people use this thing to make games as well? I mean, how do people even do that? How much code goes into a game made in GitHub?

        <figcaption> One of my orginal characters. It's called a welcotot.</figcaption>
        <p> This little guy represents a lot of what goes on in my life. It may be small and seemingly uninteresting, but when it starts doing it's thing it becomes more happy and cheerful. </p>
        <p> I didn't expect to be making a website in this class, but it's a skill that'll probably be useful later. Might use it in future projects. If anything, this was really fun to work on and mess with, despite me being a little lazy while working on it. </p>
